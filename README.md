# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python mini projects I have completed over time as part of my self-study journey after high school.

These projects were developed while practicing programming through platforms like **freeCodeCamp**, **YouTube tutorials**, and guided exercises. They helped me build a strong foundation in Python and understand key programming concepts such as:

- Variables, data types, and control flow
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions and modular code
- Dictionaries and lists
- String manipulation
- File handling
- Problem-solving logic

These projects are not meant to be advanced or complex, but they reflect consistent effort to learn and apply Python through hands-on practice.
